FreeCAD is a parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects
of any size. Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your design by 
going back into your model history and changing its parameters. 
FreeCAD is open-source and highly customizable, scriptable and extensible.

FreeCAD is multiplatform (Windows, Mac and Linux), and reads and writes many 
open file formats such as STEP, IGES, STL, SVG, DXF, OBJ, IFC, DAE and many 
others.
